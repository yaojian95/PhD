- Polarized Galactic synchrotron and thermal dust signals are expected to have **some degree of correlation**, due to the same underlying Galactic magnetic field: cross correlation between the S-PASS and Planck maps at 353 GHz

## 0703 G. Puglisi Forecasting the Contribution of Polarized Extragalactic Radio Sources in  CMB Observations

### Galactic Foregrounds

To date, several challenges have prevented the detection of primordial B-modes mostly because of the diffuse polarized radiation coming from the Milky Way, known as Galactic foregrounds. 

The list of Galactic foregrounds is long and includes anything emitting at submillimeter wavelengths between us and the CMB: 
- thermal dust
- synchrotron radiation
- free–free emission,
- and several molecular *line emissions* (i.e., CO line). 

All these emissions are partially polarized and the main contribution comes from synchrotron and dust (both polarized up to 20% level. At high frequencies(ν > 90 GHz), such a large polarization degree is produced by thermal dust grains aligning along the Galactic magnetic field lines. At low frequencies (ν < 70 GHz), cosmic electrons spiralling into the Galactic magnetic field produce synchrotron radiation. Molecular lines are expected to be polarized at lower levels ~1% whereas free–free emission can essentially be considered unpolarized.

At smaller scales, the **extragalactic radio sources (ERS)** and star-forming dusty galaxies are the major contaminants.

### Mechanism 
The polarized emission of radio sources is mostly due to synchrotron radiation sourced by an  active galactic nucleus (AGN), where a central super-massive black hole ($10^6 - 10^9 M_{\odot}$ ) is hosted.

- Edge-on : steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs)
- pole-on: flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs)

There is an increasing interest in polarization of ERS at **high radio frequencies**, not only to better understand the physics behind the emitting system, e.g., the degree of ordering of the magnetic field and the direction of its field lines , but also because polarized ERS will be largely detected by forthcoming CMB experiments. Furthermore, the ERS contaminating signal in the polarization power spectra cannot be neglected to assess the power spectrum of ***lensing B-modes***.
**(Davide's thesis)**
Some galaxies host an active galactic nucleus, which is thought to be the accretion  
of a massive black hole. These galaxies have a strong synchrotron emission and are loud in the radio frequencies. **These sources have a Poissonian statistics and therefore have white angular power spectrum.**   At small scales the signal from unresolved point sources dominates over the CMB signal, which is suppressed by Silk damping. Point sources can be polarized, typically between 1 and 5%, which makes them a potential foreground for small scales CMB polarization measurements.

### Forecast for CMB experiments
To forecast the contribution of radio point sources both in total intensity and polarized flux densities given the nominal specifics of a CMB experiment.
