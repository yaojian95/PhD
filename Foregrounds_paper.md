- Polarized Galactic synchrotron and thermal dust signals are expected to have **some degree of correlation**, due to the same underlying Galactic magnetic field: cross correlation between the S-PASS and Planck maps at 353 GHz

## 0703 G. Puglisi Forecasting the Contribution of Polarized Extragalactic Radio Sources in  CMB Observations

### Galactic Foregrounds

To date, several challenges have prevented the detection of primordial B-modes mostly because of the diffuse polarized radiation coming from the Milky Way, known as Galactic foregrounds. 

The list of Galactic foregrounds is long and includes anything emitting at submillimeter wavelengths between us and the CMB: 
- thermal dust
- synchrotron radiation
- free–free emission,
- and several molecular *line emissions* (i.e., CO line). 

All these emissions are partially polarized and the main contribution comes from synchrotron and dust (both polarized up to 20% level. At high frequencies(ν > 90 GHz), such a large polarization degree is produced by thermal dust grains aligning along the Galactic magnetic field lines. At low frequencies (ν < 70 GHz), cosmic electrons spiralling into the Galactic magnetic field produce synchrotron radiation. Molecular lines are expected to be polarized at lower levels ~1% whereas free–free emission can essentially be considered unpolarized.

### Extragalactic foregrounds

At smaller scales, the **extragalactic radio sources (ERS)** and star-forming dusty galaxies are the major contaminants.

### Mechanism 
The polarized emission of radio sources is mostly due to synchrotron radiation sourced by an  active galactic nucleus (AGN), where a central super-massive black hole ($10^6 - 10^9 M_{\odot}$ ) is hosted.

- Edge-on : steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs)
- pole-on: flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs)

There is an increasing interest in polarization of ERS at **high radio frequencies**, not only to better understand the physics behind the emitting system, e.g., the degree of ordering of the magnetic field and the direction of its field lines , but also because polarized ERS will be largely detected by forthcoming CMB experiments. Furthermore, the ERS contaminating signal in the polarization power spectra cannot be neglected to assess the power spectrum of ***lensing B-modes***.
**(Davide's thesis)**
Some galaxies host an active galactic nucleus, which is thought to be the accretion  
of a massive black hole. These galaxies have a strong synchrotron emission and are loud in the radio frequencies. **These sources have a Poissonian statistics and therefore have white angular power spectrum.**   At small scales the signal from unresolved point sources dominates over the CMB signal, which is suppressed by Silk damping. Point sources can be polarized, typically between 1 and 5%, which makes them a potential foreground for small scales CMB polarization measurements.

### Forecast for CMB experiments
To forecast the contribution of radio point sources both in total intensity and polarized flux densities given the nominal specifics of a CMB experiment.

Interstellar magnetic fields are tied to the interstellar gas. Together with cosmic rays they form a dynamical system that is an important (but debated) facet of the physics of galaxies. Magnetic fields play a pivotal role because they control the density and distribution of cosmic rays, and they act on the dynamics if the gas. Much of the physics involved in this interplay is encoded in the structure of interstellar magnetic fields. Observations of synchrotron emission and its polarization, as well as Faraday rotation and dust polarization, provide the means to characterize the structure of magnetic fields within galaxies.

# 1005 The C-Band All-Sky Survey (C-BASS): Simulated parametric fitting in single pixels in total intensity and  polarization

## Sumarizing the foreground models for each component.

Along any one line of sight there are multiple populations of synchrotron-emitting electrons, with each population potentially emitting with a different spectral index.  
The frequency spectrum of such a superposition can be  (neatly) parametrised using a **moment expansion** (Chluba  et al. 2017). However, such an expansion introduces more free parameters into the spectral models than there are observations at frequencies that are dominated by synchrotron  emission. Given the small number of low-frequency surveys  currently available, instead of a full moment expansion, we  consider the inclusion of a simple curvature term in the synchrotron spectral model.

At lower frequencies, and close to the Galactic plane, the synchrotron emission is less polarized  
due to **Faraday depolarization**.

# 1007 Planck 2018 inflation
- For well over a decade, the base-ΛCDM model has been established as the simplest viable cosmological model. Its six free  parameters can be divided into **primordial and late-time parameters**. The former describe the state of perturbations on observable  scales prior to re-entering the Hubble radius  around recombination($A_s, n_s$); The late-time parameters, on the other hand, determine the linear evolution of perturbations after re-entering the Hubble radius($\Omega_b, \Omega_c, \theta_{MC}, \tau$). 

# 1025 Euclid: Forecast constraints on consistency tests of the ΛCDM model ?
- The main cosmological probes of Euclid will be: galaxy clustering from the spectroscopic survey, and galaxy clustering and weak lensing from the photometric survey.
