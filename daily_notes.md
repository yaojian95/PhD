Simulate foreground maps, then use likelihood analysis to constrain tbe spectral index of synchrotron, **with and without CBASS data** , to see whether including CBASS data will decreasing the error or not. 
- Use PySM to simulate SPASS 2.3GHz, CBASS 5, WMAP K 23, Ka 33, Planck 28GHz.
- PySM d0s0, same spectral index all the sky (or **first only synchrotron**)
- first full sky, without beam, homogeneous noise
- Someone's PhD thesis  Chapter 6 to know the details of likelihood for synchrotron.
